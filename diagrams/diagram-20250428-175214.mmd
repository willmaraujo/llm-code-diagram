Here is the Mermaid Flowchart syntax for the given documentation:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[TaskList] -->|TaskItemComponent|> B[TaskItem]
    B -->|NotificationService|> C[Notification]
    D(TaskDetails) --> E(TaskService)
    F(Notification) --> G(Alert)
```

Please note that the syntax is simplified and does not include all the classes mentioned in the documentation.
