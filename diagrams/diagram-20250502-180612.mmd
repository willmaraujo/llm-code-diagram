Alright, I need to create a Mermaid dependency graph based on the provided TypeScript files. Let me start by understanding each file and identifying dependencies.

First, looking at `app-routing.module.ts`, it imports RouterModule and defines routes. So, AppRoutingModule depends on RouterModule.

Next, in `app.component.spec.ts`, RouterTestingModule is imported for testing AppComponent, but this isn't a direct dependency, so I can ignore test modules.

In `app.module.ts`, AppModule declares AppComponent and NavbarComponent. It imports BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule. So, AppModule depends on these three modules.

`app.component.ts` doesn't import any other components directly, so no dependencies there.

Moving to `navbar/navbar.component.ts`, it's a standalone component without any imports besides Component. So, NavbarComponent has no dependencies beyond Angular core.

In `tasks/tasks.module.ts`, TasksModule declares TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, and TaskDetailsComponent. It imports CommonModule. So, TasksModule depends on CommonModule.

Looking at `task-details/task-details.component.ts`, it uses TaskService and NotificationService via dependency injection. This means TaskDetailsComponent depends on these services.

Now, checking the service files: Both NotificationService and TaskService are provided in the root, so they don't depend on each other or any modules beyond what's already imported.

Putting this all together:

- The main dependencies start with BrowserModule being imported by AppModule.
- AppRoutingModule imports RouterModule.
- TasksModule depends on CommonModule.
- AppComponent is declared in AppModule and doesn't have direct dependencies except through its module.
- TaskDetailsComponent has dependencies on services, but since these are provided at the root, they're already included in the module setup.

I should structure the Mermaid diagram with a subgraph for AppModule containing its main components. Then, declare all dependencies outside the subgraphs as per the rules. Make sure to use correct syntax: NodeA --> NodeB or NodeA -->|Label|NodeB without any invalid combinations.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end
AppModule --> BrowserModule
AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
BrowserModule --> app.component.ts
RouterModule --> AppRoutingModule
TasksModule --> CommonModule
TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService
TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
```
