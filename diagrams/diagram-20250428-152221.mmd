Here is the Mermaid graph representing the project dependencies between modules, components, and services:

graph LR
    subgraph AppModule
        AppRoutingModule --> RouterModule
        TasksModule --> CommonModule
    end

    subgraph Components
        AppComponent --> [RouterModule]
        NavbarComponent -->
        TaskListComponent -->
        TaskItemComponent -->
        TaskDetailsComponent -->
    end

    subgraph Services
        TaskService --> TaskDetailsComponent
        NotificationService --> TaskDetailsComponent
    end

    TaskDetailsService --> TaskService
    TasksModule --> AppModule

Note: The graph only shows the dependencies between existing entities in the input code, without inventing any new modules, components, or services.
