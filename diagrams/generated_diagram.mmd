Okay, I need to analyze the provided Python project and generate a dependency graph using Mermaid syntax. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user mentioned modules, classes, and functions as key elements to identify. So, I should start by listing out all these components from the code snippet they provided. The code has Module1 with two functions: Function1 and Function2. Function1 is called inside Module1, which makes sense because it's likely defined there. Then, Function2 is also within Module1 but doesn't seem to call anything else yet.

Next, looking at imports, Module1 imports Module2. That means there's a dependency from Module1 to Module2. So in the graph, I'll represent this with an import arrow pointing from Module1 to Module2.

Now, for function calls. Function1 calls Function2, so that creates another edge pointing from Function1 to Function2 within Module1. Additionally, in Module2, there's a class called Class1, and it has a method called Method1 which might call another method, perhaps Method2. So I should include these class relationships as well.

I also notice that within Module2, there are references to functions like print_message and get_data. Since these are function calls made inside the module, they should be represented with arrows pointing from the class or module to those functions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the graph starting from the top-level modules, showing their imports and function calls, then diving into classes and their methods within those modules. Each arrow will represent a specific relationship: imports, function calls, method invocations, etc.

I need to ensure that the Mermaid syntax is correct, using appropriate notations for modularity, class inheritance, and method relationships. This way, when the graph is rendered, it clearly shows all the dependencies and interactions between modules, classes, and functions.

To analyze the provided Python code and generate a dependency graph in Mermaid format, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Modules, Classes, and Functions**: 
   - `Module1` contains two functions: `Function1` and `Function2`.
   - `Module2` is imported by `Module1`.
   - `Class1` is defined in `Module2` with methods `Method1` and `Method2`.

2. **Extract Relationships**:
   - **Imports**: `Module1` imports `Module2`.
   - **Function Calls**: 
     - `Function1` calls `Function2` within `Module1`.
     - `Class1` has method `Method1` which calls `print_message()` and `get_data()`, presumably defined in the same or imported modules.

3. **Generate Mermaid Syntax**:
   - Use arrows (`-->`) to represent imports, function calls, and class relationships.
   - Class methods and function calls within classes are represented using modularity syntax.

    A -->|calls| B[Function1]
    B -->|calls| C[Function2]
    D -->|contains| class B[Class1]
    B -->|method| B[Method1]
    B -->|calls| D.print_message
    B -->|calls| D.get_data
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Dependencies**: `Module1` imports `Module2`, so there is a dependency arrow from `Module1` to `Module2`.
- **Function Calls**: Within `Module1`, `Function1` calls `Function2`. This is represented by an arrow from `Function1` to `Function2`.
- **Class Definition and Method Calls**: `Module2` contains the `Class1` class. The methods of `Class1` (`Method1`) call other functions (`print_message()` and `get_data()`), which are shown as calls within the same module.

This graph provides a clear overview of the relationships between modules, functions, and classes in the codebase.
