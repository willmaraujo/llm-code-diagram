Based on the provided TypeScript files, I will provide a correct dependency graph for the Angular project using Mermaid syntax.

**Good Example:**
```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end
```

**Dependency Graph:**

1. `app.module.ts`:
	* `RouterModule`: Injected by `AppRoutingModule`.
2. `app-routing.module.ts`:
	* Imports `RouterModule`
3. `app.component.spec.ts`:
	* Uses `TaskListComponent`, `TaskItemComponent`, and `TaskDetailsComponent`.
4. `tasks.module.ts`:
	* Imports `TaskService` from `notification.service.ts`.
5. `notifications.service.ts`:
	* Injected by `NotificationService`.
6. `task.service.ts`:
	* Injected by `TaskService`.

**Correct Example:**
```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

subgraph AppRoutingModule
  TasksModule --> TaskService
  TasksModule --> NotificationService
```

This dependency graph adheres to the following rules:

1. Each subgraph contains only one node.
2. Each node is a dependency of another node, represented by an arrow with a `-->` symbol.
3. Dependencies are injected by services, such as `TaskService` and `NotificationService`.
4. All dependencies are listed outside each subgraph.

Note that the corrected example uses proper Mermaid syntax to represent the dependency graph.
