Here is the essential flowchart syntax information extracted from the Mermaid documentation:

**Flowchart Syntax**

Mermaid uses a simple syntax to create flowcharts. Here are the basic elements:

* `start` : The starting point of the chart
* `end` : The ending point of the chart
* `node` : A node in the chart, which can have multiple labels (e.g., text, icon, shape)
* `edge` : An edge connecting two nodes
* `arrow` : An arrow pointing from one node to another

**Node Syntax**

A node has the following syntax:
```
[node id] [label]
```
Where:

* `[node id]` is a unique identifier for the node
* `[label]` is the text or icon that appears on the node

Example: `node1 This is a node`

**Edge Syntax**

An edge has the following syntax:
```
[from] -> [to] [label]
```
Where:

* `[from]` is the node that the edge starts from
* `[to]` is the node that the edge points to
* `[label]` is an optional label for the edge

Example: `node1 -> node2 "This is a link"`

**Flowchart Structure**

A flowchart typically consists of:

1. A starting node (`start`)
2. One or more nodes that represent decisions, actions, or processes
3. Edges connecting these nodes to form a logical sequence

Here's an example of a simple flowchart:
```
graph LR
  start --> node1[This is the start]
  node1 -->|Yes|> node2[Do something]
  node2 --> node3[End]
  node1 -->|No|> node4[Else]
  node4 --> node5[Do something else]
  node5 --> node3[End]
```
In this example:

* `start` is the starting node
* `node1` represents a decision (Yes/No)
* `node2` and `node3` represent actions or processes
* `node4` and `node5` represent alternative paths

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
