Here is the Mermaid Flowchart syntax representing the dependencies and relationships between components in the given documentation:

```
graph LR
    A[App] -->|uses| B(TaskService)
    A -->|uses| C(NotificationService)
    D(TaskListComponent) -->|uses| E(TaskItemComponent)
    F(TaskDetailsComponent) -->|uses| G(TaskService)
    H(NotificationService) -->|used by| F
    I(TaskService) -->|provided by| H
    J(TaskService) -->|used by| F
```

In this flowchart:

* The App (A) uses TaskService (B) and NotificationService (C).
* TaskListComponent (D) uses TaskItemComponent (E).
* TaskDetailsComponent (F) uses TaskService (I) and NotificationService (H).
* NotificationService (H) is provided by TaskService (I).

Please note that this flowchart only represents the dependencies and relationships between components, without considering the actual implementation details.
