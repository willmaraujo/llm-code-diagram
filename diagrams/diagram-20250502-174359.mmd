Alright, I need to figure out how to create a correct dependency graph using Mermaid syntax based on the provided TypeScript files. Let me start by understanding the structure and dependencies within the project.

First, looking at the files, I see that the main module is AppModule. It declares AppComponent and NavbarComponent, and imports BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule. So, in the graph, AppModule should have arrows pointing to these modules: BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule.

Next,AppComponent is imported by AppModule, so there's a dependency from AppComponent to its dependencies. Looking at app.component.ts, it doesn't import any services directly, but in app.module.ts, AppComponent is declared, so it probably uses other components like NavbarComponent. Therefore, I'll connect AppComponent to NavbarComponent.

The TasksModule is imported by AppModule and has its own components: TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, and TaskDetailsComponent. These components are declared within the module, so they should be listed inside a subgraph for TasksModule. Additionally, TaskDetailsComponent uses TaskService and NotificationService, which are services provided by their respective modules.

Looking at task-details.component.ts, it imports TaskService and NotificationService. Therefore, TaskDetailsComponent depends on these services. So, in the graph, I'll connect TaskDetailsComponent to both TaskService and NotificationService.

I also need to consider dependencies from other files. For example, app-routing.module.ts is a separate module that might be imported elsewhere. In app.module.ts, RouterModule is imported via RouterModule, so I should include it as a node connected from AppModule.

Now, putting this all together, I'll structure the graph with subgraphs for each major module. The main nodes will be AppModule, BrowserModule, RouterModule, TasksModule, AppComponent, NavbarComponent, TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent, TaskService, and NotificationService.

I need to ensure that all connections are correct. From AppModule, arrows go to BrowserModule, RouterModule, and TasksModule.AppComponent is connected to its dependencies, which include NavbarComponent. Inside the TasksModule subgraph, each component points to their own dependencies: TaskDetailsComponent points to both services.

I must avoid mistakes like listing modules inside other modules where they don't belong. For example, app-routing.module shouldn't be nested within TasksModule or AppModule unless imported there. Also, I need to ensure that all nodes are correctly listed without duplication and that dependencies are accurately represented with --> arrows.

Finally, I'll structure the Mermaid code accordingly, starting with ```mermaid graph LR, then defining each node and their connections based on the analysis.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end
AppModule --> BrowserModule
AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule

AppComponent -->|depends on| NavbarComponent

subgraph TasksModule
  TaskListComponent
  TaskItemComponent
  TaskDetailsComponent
end

TaskDetailsComponent -->|uses| NotificationService
TaskDetailsComponent -->|uses| TaskService

TasksModule --> CommonModule
```

This diagram:
1. Shows the main module structure and dependencies
2. Creates subgraphs for major modules (AppModule, TasksModule)
3. Maintains proper directionality with arrows
4. Properly displays component/service relationships
5. Avoids mistakes seen in the bad example
6. Uses exact names from the TypeScript files
