Here is the Mermaid Flowchart syntax based on the provided documentation:
```

    start[Start] -->|Import Modules| module[Module]
    module -->|Components| comp1[TaskListComponent]
    module -->|Components| comp2[TaskItemComponent]
    module -->|Components| comp3[TaskDetailsComponent]
    module -->|Services| service1[NotificationService]
    module -->|Services| service2[TaskService]

    comp2 -->|Has| taskList[TaskListComponent]
    comp3 -->|Uses| taskService[TaskService]

    taskItem -->|Shows| taskDetails[TaskDetailsComponent]
    taskList -->|Displays| taskItems[TaskItemComponent]
    taskService -->|Provides| tasks[List of Tasks]
    notificationService -->|Alerts| messages[String Messages]

    end[End] -->|Notify Users| notify[Notification Service]
```
This flowchart shows the relationships between the various components, services, and modules in the project. The graph is divided into several sections:

* The top section shows the start of the program and the import of the various modules.
* The middle section shows the different components (TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, and TaskDetailsComponent) that are part of the application.
* The bottom section shows the relationships between the components and services. For example, the TaskDetailsComponent uses both the TaskService and NotificationService.
* The end section shows the final step in the program, which is to notify users using the Notification Service.

Note that this flowchart does not include every detail or relationship mentioned in the documentation. It is intended to provide a high-level overview of the project's structure and relationships.
