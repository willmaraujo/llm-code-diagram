Here is the corrected Mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[App] -->|import| B[TestComponent]
    B -->|extends| C[ReactComponent]
    C -->|uses| D[NotificationService]
    D -->|alert| E[ConsoleLog]
    F(TaskList)-->|renders| G(TaskListComponent)
    G -->|displays| H[List of Tasks]
    I(TaskItem)-->|renders| J(TaskItemComponent)
    J -->|displays| K[Task Details]
    L(TaskDetails)-->|renders| M(TaskDetailsComponent)
    M -->|displays| N[Task Details]
    O(NotificationService)-->|sends notification| P[ConsoleLog]
```

This Mermaid diagram represents the flow of components and services in your application. It shows how the `App` component imports the `TestComponent`, which extends a `ReactComponent`. The `NotificationService` is used by the `TaskItemComponent` to send an alert, which is displayed on the console.
