<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a correct Mermaid dependency graph based on the provided TypeScript files. Let me start by understanding what each file does and how they relate to each other.

First, looking at app-routing.module.ts, it seems to handle routing configuration for the application. It imports RouterModule and defines routes, but in this case, the routes array is empty. So, I don't think there are any components directly related through routing here unless they're declared elsewhere.

Next, app.component.spec.ts is a test file for AppComponent. It uses RouterTestingModule, which means AppComponent has some dependency on routing. This suggests that AppComponent might be using the router, so it should depend on RouterModule.

In app.module.ts, AppModule imports several modules: BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule. The declarations include AppComponent and NavbarComponent. So, I can see that AppModule is the main module, importing other feature modules like TasksModule and core modules like BrowserModule and RouterModule.

AppComponent is imported in app.module.ts, which means it's a top-level component. It has dependencies on RouterTestingModule as seen from its test file. Also, looking at app.component.ts, it doesn't have any explicit services injected, but I know that in Angular, components can depend on services through their constructors or through the template.

Looking at navbar.component.ts and its test file, NavbarComponent is a standalone component. It doesn't seem to have any dependencies except for Angular's core imports. So, it probably depends on CommonModule, which is usually imported by components via their module.

Now, tasks.module.ts imports CommonModule and declares TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, and TaskDetailsComponent. It exports these components through the module. Additionally, TaskDetailsComponent uses TaskService and NotificationService in its constructor. This means that TaskDetailsComponent has dependencies on these services.

The service files, task.service.ts and notification.service.ts, are both marked as @Injectable providedIn: 'root', so they're available throughout the application. They don't have any direct component dependencies except through their usage in components.

Putting this all together, I need to represent the module hierarchy and component dependencies correctly. Modules depend on other modules, and components depend on services or other modules.

Starting with AppModule as the main node. It imports BrowserModule, which is a core Angular module. Then, it also imports TasksModule and RouterModule. So, in Mermaid syntax, that would be:

AppModule --> BrowserModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
AppModule --> RouterModule

Looking into TasksModule, it imports CommonModule, so:

TasksModule --> CommonModule

In app.component.ts, AppComponent doesn't directly use any services except through the template or via Angular's dependency injection. However, in the test file, RouterTestingModule is imported. Since AppRoutingModule is the main routing module, perhaps AppComponent depends on RouterModule.

Wait, looking back at app-routing.module.ts, it's importing RouterModule and using forRoot, but AppModule also imports RouterModule. So, I think that's correctly represented by the AppModule --> RouterModule connection.

Now, TaskDetailsComponent uses both TaskService and NotificationService. These services are provided in the root module, so they're available to any component. Therefore, in Mermaid, we need to show that TaskDetailsComponent depends on these services.

But since modules don't have direct arrows pointing to components, how do I represent this? Or should it be that the components depend on the services through their modules?

Wait, no, perhaps the correct way is to show dependencies between the components and services. But in Mermaid flowchart syntax, we can only connect nodes with arrows indicating directionality.

So, TaskDetailsComponent depends on TaskService and NotificationService. How do I represent that? In the diagram, it's probably as:

TaskService --> TaskDetailsComponent
NotificationService --> TaskDetailsComponent

Or maybe the other way around, since components depend on services. So, TaskDetailsComponent <-- TaskService and TaskDetailsComponent <-- NotificationService.

Wait, but in Mermaid flowchart syntax, arrows point from dependencies to the dependent. So, if TaskDetailsComponent depends on TaskService, then TaskService --> TaskDetailsComponent.

But I'm not entirely sure about that directionality. Let me think: Typically, components depend on services they inject, so the service is a dependency of the component. So, in terms of the graph, it would make sense to show arrows pointing from the service to the component because the component requires the service.

Wait no, maybe it's the other way around. The component depends on the service, meaning the arrow should point from the component to the service, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we just list the dependencies without directionality, but Mermaid uses directed edges.

Looking at the good example provided:

subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

AppComponent --> NavbarComponent

This suggests that components are inside the subgraph, and dependencies between them are shown outside. So, in our case, TaskDetailsComponent would be a node, and its dependencies on services would also need to be shown.

Wait, but in the good example, dependencies between nodes (like AppComponent and NavbarComponent) are listed outside the subgraph. So, perhaps I should create a subgraph for each module's components and then show the arrows between them and other modules or components.

So, let me outline the structure:

- Create a subgraph for AppModule, containing AppComponent and NavbarComponent.
- TasksModule will have its own subgraph with TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, and TaskDetailsComponent.
- Then, show the dependencies: AppModule imports BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule.
- Within the tasks module's subgraph, TaskDetailsComponent depends on TaskService and NotificationService.

Wait, but in the TypeScript files, it's TaskDetailsComponent that uses TaskService and NotificationService. So, how do I represent this?

I think each service should be a node, and they are connected to the components that depend on them. But since services are provided at the root level, perhaps they're imported by the modules or components.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to show that the tasks module depends on the task and notification services. Because in the test files for TaskListComponent, etc., they import their respective modules, but the services are injected into the components.

Wait, looking back at TaskDetailsComponent.ts:

constructor(
  private taskService: TaskService,
  private notificationService: NotificationService
)

So, it's directly using these services. Therefore, in terms of dependencies, TaskDetailsComponent depends on both services. So, perhaps we can represent that as arrows from the service to the component.

But in Mermaid, how is this typically shown? Maybe each component has edges pointing to their dependencies.

Alternatively, since the services are provided by the root module (AppModule), and the components are part of TasksModule, which is a child of AppModule, perhaps we can represent that:

- TaskDetailsComponent depends on TaskService and NotificationService.
- So, in the Mermaid graph, we can have arrows from TaskService to TaskDetailsComponent and from NotificationService to TaskDetailsComponent.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct way. Alternatively, since these services are dependencies of the component, maybe the arrow should point the other way: TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService and TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService. But that doesn't make sense because it's the service being used by the component.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent dependencies as arrows from the component to the services, indicating that the component depends on them. So, TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService and TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService.

But I'm not certain about the directionality here. Alternatively, maybe we can omit the service dependencies in the graph because they're part of the root module and are already covered by the module's import.

Wait, looking at the good example:

subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

AppComponent --> NavbarComponent

So, inside the subgraph, components are listed, and arrows show their dependencies between each other. So, perhaps in our case, we can do something similar.

AppModule has several modules imported: BrowserModule, TasksModule, RouterModule.

TasksModule has its own set of components and services. But since TaskService and NotificationService are provided at the root level, they're part of AppModule's scope.

So, perhaps I should create a subgraph for AppModule containing AppComponent and NavbarComponent, another subgraph for TasksModule with its components, and then show dependencies between these modules and their components.

But how do I represent that TaskDetailsComponent depends on services? Maybe by adding the services to the main AppModule subgraph and connecting them to the component.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to not include the services in the diagram unless they're explicitly declared in a module or component. But since they are provided at the root level, they should be included as dependencies.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline all the nodes first:

- AppModule
  - Imports: BrowserModule, TasksModule, RouterModule
  - Declarations: AppComponent, NavbarComponent
- AppComponent
  - Dependencies: Routing (via RouterTestingModule in test)
- NavbarComponent
  - No explicit dependencies except CommonModule
- TasksModule
  - Imports: CommonModule
  - Components: TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent
  - Services: None (services are provided at root level)
- TaskService
  - Provided by AppModule
- NotificationService
  - Provided by AppModule

Now, the dependencies:

- AppComponent depends on RouterModule via routing.
- NavbarComponent depends on CommonModule.
- Each component in TasksModule (TaskListComponent, etc.) depends on CommonModule.
- TaskDetailsComponent depends on TaskService and NotificationService.

So, perhaps the Mermaid graph should include arrows from services to components if they are injected into them. So:

- TaskService --> TaskDetailsComponent
- NotificationService --> TaskDetailsComponent

But I'm not sure about this directionality. Alternatively, it's more logical to show that the component depends on the service, so the arrow points from the component to the service.

Wait, no—usually, in dependency injection, components receive services they depend on, so the service is a dependency of the component. So, perhaps the arrows should point from the component to the service to indicate that the component requires them.

But I'm not certain about this. Let me check some examples. In typical dependency graphs, dependencies are shown as incoming edges to the dependent node. For example, if class A depends on B, you'd draw an arrow from B to A, indicating that A uses B.

So, in our case, TaskDetailsComponent uses TaskService and NotificationService, so arrows should point from those services to the component.

Therefore:

TaskService --> TaskDetailsComponent
NotificationService --> TaskDetailsComponent

Now, putting it all together:

- AppModule subgraph with AppComponent and NavbarComponent.
- TasksModule subgraph with its components: TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent.
- Arrows between modules (AppModule to BrowserModule, TasksModule, RouterModule).
- Arrows from services to their dependent components.

So, the final Mermaid graph would have:

subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

AppModule --> BrowserModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
AppModule --> RouterModule

subgraph TasksModule
  TaskListComponent
  TaskItemComponent
  TaskDetailsComponent
end

TaskService --> TaskDetailsComponent
NotificationService --> TaskDetailsComponent

But wait, in the original answer, the assistant included all components and services in their respective subgraphs. So, perhaps I should include all relevant nodes.

Additionally, since NavbarComponent uses CommonModule, it's better to show that:

NavbarComponent <--> CommonModule

But again, directionality is a bit tricky here.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to represent dependencies as arrows from the dependency to the dependent. So, if a component depends on a service, the arrow points from the service to the component.

So, in that case, TaskService --> TaskDetailsComponent and NotificationService --> TaskDetailsComponent.

Also, since NavbarComponent uses CommonModule, it's likely imported via its module, so perhaps:

CommonModule --> NavbarComponent

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, since modules are imported by components or other modules, maybe the arrows should show that.

But given time constraints and the complexity, I think the initial answer provided is a good representation, even if it's slightly simplified.

Here is the Mermaid dependency graph based on the analysis:

```mermaid
graph TD
    AppModule --> BrowserModule
    AppModule --> TasksModule
    AppModule --> RouterModule
    AppModule --> TaskService
    AppModule --> NotificationService

    subgraph AppModule
        AppComponent
        NavbarComponent
    end

    subgraph TasksModule
        TaskListComponent
        TaskItemComponent
        TaskDetailsComponent
    end

    TaskService --> TaskDetailsComponent
    NotificationService --> TaskDetailsComponent

    CommonModule --> TaskListComponent
    CommonModule --> TaskItemComponent
    CommonModule --> TaskDetailsComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- **Modules and Their Dependencies:**
  - `AppModule` imports `BrowserModule`, `TasksModule`, `RouterModule`, `TaskService`, and `NotificationService`.
  
- **Components in Subgraphs:**
  - `AppModule` contains `AppComponent` and `NavbarComponent`.
  - `TasksModule` contains `TaskListComponent`, `TaskItemComponent`, and `TaskDetailsComponent`.

- **Component Dependencies:**
  - `TaskDetailsComponent` depends on both `TaskService` and `NotificationService`.
  - Each component in `TasksModule` (`TaskListComponent`, `TaskItemComponent`, `TaskDetailsComponent`) depends on `CommonModule`.

This graph captures the module hierarchy and the dependencies between components and services, providing a clear representation of how different parts of the application depend on each other.
