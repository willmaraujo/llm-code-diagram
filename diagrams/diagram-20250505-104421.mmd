Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to analyze the Angular project's TypeScript files and create a correct dependency graph using Mermaid syntax, following the GOOD EXAMPLE style and avoiding the BAD EXAMPLE mistakes.

First, I need to understand the structure of the project. Let me look through the provided files to identify the components, modules, and services, and their dependencies.

Starting with the AppModule. The AppModule imports BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule. So AppModule depends on BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule. Also, AppModule declares AppComponent and NavbarComponent. But in the Mermaid graph, the subgraph for AppModule should list only the declared components, which are AppComponent and NavbarComponent. Then, the dependencies from AppModule to other modules should be outside the subgraph.

Next, looking at the AppRoutingModule. It's an NgModule that imports RouterModule and exports it. But there's no explicit dependency here except for RouterModule. However, since AppRoutingModule is part of AppModule's imports, maybe it's already accounted for in the AppModule's dependencies.

Then, the TasksModule. It declares TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent, and imports CommonModule. So the subgraph for TasksModule should include those three components. The TasksModule is imported by AppModule, so there's a dependency from AppModule to TasksModule.

Looking at the TaskDetailsComponent, it uses TaskService and NotificationService. These services are provided in the root, so they're available throughout the app. But in terms of dependencies, TaskDetailsComponent depends on TaskService and NotificationService. However, in the Mermaid graph, services are typically represented as nodes, so I need to include them as nodes and connect TaskDetailsComponent to them.

Wait, but the user's GOOD EXAMPLE uses subgraphs for modules and lists the components inside. So maybe I should create subgraphs for AppModule, TasksModule, and any other modules. The services are part of the dependencies, so they should be nodes connected to the components that use them.

Let me list all the components and services:

Components:
- AppComponent
- NavbarComponent
- TaskListComponent
- TaskItemComponent
- TaskDetailsComponent

Services:
- TaskService
- NotificationService

Modules:
- AppModule
- AppRoutingModule
- TasksModule

Now, let's map the dependencies:

AppModule imports BrowserModule, TasksModule, RouterModule. So AppModule depends on BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule. But BrowserModule is a built-in Angular module, so maybe it's not part of the dependency graph unless specified. The user's GOOD EXAMPLE includes BrowserModule in the AppModule's imports, but in the example, the subgraph for AppModule lists the components, and the dependencies are outside. Wait, the GOOD EXAMPLE shows AppModule as a subgraph with its declared components, and then dependencies from AppModule to RouterModule and TasksModule.

Wait, the GOOD EXAMPLE's AppModule subgraph has AppComponent and NavbarComponent. Then, AppModule has dependencies to RouterModule and TasksModule. But in the actual code, AppModule imports RouterModule and TasksModule, so those are dependencies. So the graph should show AppModule --> RouterModule and AppModule --> TasksModule.

But the AppRoutingModule is a separate module. Wait, the AppRoutingModule is an NgModule that imports RouterModule and exports it. So in the code, AppRoutingModule is part of AppModule's imports? Wait, looking back: in AppModule's imports, it has RouterModule. Wait, no. Let me check the AppModule.ts:

In AppModule.ts, the imports are [BrowserModule, TasksModule, RouterModule]. So RouterModule is imported directly into AppModule. So the AppModule depends on RouterModule. But AppRoutingModule is a separate NgModule. Wait, the AppRoutingModule is in the app-routing.module.ts file. So in AppModule's imports, it's RouterModule, not AppRoutingModule. Wait, the AppRoutingModule is the NgModule that imports RouterModule. Wait, the AppRoutingModule is defined in app-routing.module.ts, and in AppModule's imports, it's RouterModule, not AppRoutingModule. Wait, no. Let me check:

In AppModule.ts, the imports are [BrowserModule, TasksModule, RouterModule]. So the RouterModule is imported directly. But the AppRoutingModule is a separate NgModule. Wait, the AppRoutingModule is an NgModule that imports RouterModule.forRoot(routes), so it's a different module. Wait, but in the AppModule's imports, it's RouterModule, not AppRoutingModule. So perhaps the AppRoutingModule is not directly imported into AppModule. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recheck.

Looking at the AppModule.ts:

@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule, TasksModule, RouterModule],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})

Wait, the imports include RouterModule, not AppRoutingModule. So the RouterModule is imported directly into AppModule. But the AppRoutingModule is another NgModule that imports RouterModule.forRoot(routes). So the AppRoutingModule is not part of the imports in AppModule. Therefore, the dependencies for AppModule are BrowserModule, TasksModule, and RouterModule. But the AppRoutingModule is not directly imported into AppModule. So maybe the AppRoutingModule isn't part of the dependency graph here. Hmm, perhaps the user's GOOD EXAMPLE includes the RouterModule as a dependency of AppModule, even though it's part of the AppRoutingModule. Or maybe the AppRoutingModule is not part of the graph because it's not imported into AppModule. Wait, the AppModule's imports include RouterModule, not AppRoutingModule. So the RouterModule is a dependency of AppModule. The AppRoutingModule is a separate NgModule that is not directly imported into AppModule. So in the graph, AppModule depends on RouterModule, and the AppRoutingModule is not part of the graph unless it's imported somewhere else.

Wait, the AppRoutingModule is in app-routing.module.ts. The AppModule's imports include RouterModule. So the RouterModule is the one that's imported into AppModule, and the AppRoutingModule is not imported. So the AppRoutingModule is not part of the dependency graph. Therefore, in the graph, AppModule depends on RouterModule, and TasksModule.

Then, the TasksModule is imported into AppModule, so AppModule --> TasksModule.

Now, the TasksModule's declarations are TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent. So the subgraph for TasksModule includes those three components. The TasksModule imports CommonModule, but CommonModule is a built-in Angular module, so maybe it's not part of the graph. So in the graph, the TasksModule subgraph has the three components, and the dependencies are from TasksModule to CommonModule, but that's not needed unless specified. The user's GOOD EXAMPLE doesn't include built-in modules, so perhaps they are omitted.

Now, looking at the components:

- TaskDetailsComponent uses TaskService and NotificationService. So TaskDetailsComponent depends on TaskService and NotificationService. These services are provided in the root (since they are providedIn: 'root'), so they are available globally. But in the graph, we need to represent their dependencies. So TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService and TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService.

But in the Mermaid syntax, how do we represent that? The user's example uses NodeA --> NodeB or NodeA -->|Label|NodeB. So for each dependency, we need to create an arrow from the component to the service.

Also, the TaskService is used by TaskDetailsComponent. The TaskService is in the services folder, so it's a separate node. Similarly, NotificationService is another node.

So, putting it all together:

Subgraphs:
- AppModule: AppComponent, NavbarComponent
- TasksModule: TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent

Dependencies:
- AppModule --> RouterModule (since it's imported)
- AppModule --> TasksModule (since it's imported)
- TasksModule --> CommonModule (but maybe not included)
- TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
- TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService

Wait, but the user's GOOD EXAMPLE doesn't include built-in modules like CommonModule. So in the graph, we might omit them. So the TasksModule's dependencies would be CommonModule, but if we don't include it, then the TasksModule subgraph has only the three components, and the dependencies from AppModule to TasksModule and RouterModule.

So the final graph would have:

AppModule subgraph with AppComponent and NavbarComponent.

TasksModule subgraph with TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent.

Then, dependencies:

AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService

Wait, but what about the TaskService and NotificationService? Are they part of the graph? The user's GOOD EXAMPLE includes BrowserModule as a dependency of AppModule, but in the example, the subgraph for AppModule includes the components, and the dependencies are outside. So in our case, the AppModule depends on RouterModule and TasksModule. The TaskService and NotificationService are services, so they should be nodes in the graph, connected to the components that use them.

So the full graph would have:

- AppModule
- RouterModule
- TasksModule
- TaskService
- NotificationService
- Components: AppComponent, NavbarComponent, TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent

So the dependencies are:

AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService

But in the GOOD EXAMPLE, the AppModule subgraph has the components, and the dependencies are from AppModule to RouterModule and TasksModule. So the graph starts with the subgraphs for modules, then the dependencies from modules to other modules or services.

Wait, but the services are not modules. So they are separate nodes. So the graph would have:

graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

subgraph TasksModule
  TaskListComponent
  TaskItemComponent
  TaskDetailsComponent
end

AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService

But the user's GOOD EXAMPLE doesn't have the services as nodes. Wait, looking back at the GOOD EXAMPLE:

The GOOD EXAMPLE's graph is:

graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

AppComponent --> NavbarComponent
NavbarComponent --> RouterModule

So in this example, RouterModule is a node, and NavbarComponent depends on it. But in our case, the AppModule depends on RouterModule and TasksModule, and TaskDetailsComponent depends on TaskService and NotificationService.

But the user's GOOD EXAMPLE includes RouterModule as a node, even though it's a built-in module. So perhaps in our case, we should include RouterModule as a node, and the dependencies from AppModule to it.

So the graph would have:

AppModule subgraph with AppComponent and NavbarComponent.

Then, AppModule --> RouterModule (since it's imported).

AppModule --> TasksModule (since it's imported).

Then, the TasksModule subgraph has TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent.

Then, TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService and TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService.

But the user's GOOD EXAMPLE has the dependencies from components to modules. So in our case, the TaskDetailsComponent is part of TasksModule, so the dependencies from TaskDetailsComponent to the services are correct.

Now, checking if all dependencies are covered.

- AppComponent is declared in AppModule, no dependencies.
- NavbarComponent is declared in AppModule, no dependencies.
- TaskListComponent, TaskItemComponent, TaskDetailsComponent are in TasksModule.
- TaskDetailsComponent uses TaskService and NotificationService, so those are dependencies.
- AppModule imports RouterModule and TasksModule, so those are dependencies.

But what about the TaskService and NotificationService? Are they declared in any module? The TaskService is in the services folder, but in the code, they are providedIn: 'root', so they are available globally. So they are separate nodes in the graph.

So the final Mermaid code would have:

graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

subgraph TasksModule
  TaskListComponent
  TaskItemComponent
  TaskDetailsComponent
end

AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
Task,DetailsComponent --> NotificationService

Wait, but the user's GOOD EXAMPLE has the dependencies from components to modules. So in our case, the AppModule depends on RouterModule and TasksModule, which are nodes. The TaskDetailsComponent depends on the services.

But in the GOOD EXAMPLE, the dependencies are from components to modules. So maybe the services are also nodes, and the components depend on them.

So the Mermaid code would be:

graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

subgraph TasksModule
  TaskListComponent
  TaskItemComponent
  TaskDetailsComponent
end

AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService

But the user's GOOD EXAMPLE doesn't have the services as nodes, but in our case, the services are part of the dependencies. So I think it's correct to include them.

Now, checking for any other dependencies. For example, does TaskDetailsComponent depend on anything else? It uses TaskService and NotificationService, which are services. The TaskListComponent and TaskItemComponent don't have any dependencies mentioned in the code. So they don't need to be connected to anything else.

So the final answer would have the subgraphs for AppModule and TasksModule, the dependencies from AppModule to RouterModule and TasksModule, and TaskDetailsComponent to TaskService and NotificationService.

Now, ensuring that the Mermaid syntax is correct. The subgraphs are defined with subgraph, and the arrows are from the nodes to the dependencies.

So the code would be:

graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

subgraph TasksModule
  TaskListComponent
  TaskItemComponent
  TaskDetailsComponent
end

AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService

But the user's GOOD EXAMPLE includes the dependencies from components to modules. For example, NavbarComponent --> RouterModule. But in our case, the AppModule depends on RouterModule, not the NavbarComponent. So that's different.

Wait, in the GOOD EXAMPLE, the NavbarComponent is in the AppModule subgraph, and the dependency is from NavbarComponent to RouterModule. But in our case, the AppModule is the one that imports RouterModule. So the correct dependency is AppModule --> RouterModule, not NavbarComponent.

Therefore, the code as written is correct.

Now, I need to make sure that all the dependencies are captured. Also, the services are nodes, and the components that use them are connected to them.

Yes, that seems right. So the final Mermaid code should be as above.
</think>

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph AppModule
  AppComponent
  NavbarComponent
end

subgraph TasksModule
  TaskListComponent
  TaskItemComponent
  TaskDetailsComponent
end

AppModule --> RouterModule
AppModule --> TasksModule
TaskDetailsComponent --> TaskService
TaskDetailsComponent --> NotificationService
```

### Explanation:
1. **Subgraphs**:
   - `AppModule` contains `AppComponent` and `NavbarComponent`.
   - `TasksModule` contains `TaskListComponent`, `TaskItemComponent`, and `TaskDetailsComponent`.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - `AppModule` depends on `RouterModule` and `TasksModule` (as they are imported into `AppModule`).
   - `TaskDetailsComponent` depends on `TaskService` and `NotificationService` (services used in its implementation).

3. **Omitted Built-in Modules**:
   - `BrowserModule` and `CommonModule` are not included as they are Angular’s built-in modules and not part of the custom dependency graph.

This structure mirrors the GOOD EXAMPLE style, ensuring clarity and correctness while avoiding the pitfalls of the BAD EXAMPLE.
